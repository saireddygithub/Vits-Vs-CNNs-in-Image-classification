# Vits-Vs-CNNs-in-Image-classification
Assignment tasks:
1. Select a technique to describe, and choose a focus
Any machine-learning or neural-network technique we have covered so far in this course is acceptable. If you wish to challenge yourself with something we haven't covered yet, that is also okay, but consider whether you are able to do it justice. 

Since these topics are broad, you will want to focus on one particular aspect to master. For example, you might want to take a detailed look at how different kernels change the behaviour of SVM, or do a deep dive on how a Multilayer Perceptron's performance changes with the depth or width of the network.  Remember, however, that your objective is to teach others about how this works so that they might be able to use it in their own work.

2. Read about the technique you want to teach
Read blogs and scientific papers to collect the information you want to convey in your tutorial, then spend some time condensing the key points. Make sure you keep track of your sources so you can cite them appropriately!

3. If necessary for your technique, select a dataset for your tutorial
You may also choose your own dataset, but please make an effort to check that it has not been used as the subject of a similar tutorial before.

4. Create code, text and figures
Demonstrate the technique you are focusing on through code, and use it to create figures that show off what is good, useful or informative about this. Think about the words you want to use to convey that.

5. Record, write or format your tutorial
Take the work above and transform it into a tutorial. Remember, your objective is to educate people about why this particular technique is great and how they can use it to improve their work.

6. Edit as necessary
Once you have a draft, start fine tuning it.
